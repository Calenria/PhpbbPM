PhpbbPM README


How it works:

On player game join, if the player got a new pm, a reminder is displayed.
Every X minutes (7 by default), if the player got a new pm, a reminder is displayed either.

You can send/read/list your pm (see the Usage section)

You can add a sign displaying the amount of unread messages you have. (Default: Just write on the first line of the sign: PhpbbPM)


Usage:

/pmhelp
display in-game help for phpbbpm

/pmlist
list all new pm

/pmread [id]
read new pm.
id (gave by pmlist) is optional, without it the last new pm you received will be displayed.

/pmsend <player> <subject> <message>
send a pm.
the subject must be in one word. if you use an underscore ('_'), it will be replaced by a space (' ').


Installation:

Make sure you have a phpbb 3 forum installed.
Make sure your players have a similar name on your forum and on Minecraft.
Put phpbbpm.jar and the phpbbpm folder into your bukkit plugins folder.

Edit config.properties and specify the database properties of your phpbb forum.
There are also some options you can configure like the message the reminder/sign will display and its frequency.

You can edit pseudo.fix to specify the forum's pseudo of an user. Otherwise, PhpbbPM will asume that in-game_pseudo = *forum_pseudo* 

Note: if the phpbbpm folder or a config file does not exists, a default one will be generate.


Known bug:

If you have players with similar pseudo, the plugin can match the wrong user because the search is made by a lower(username) = lower('%pseudo%') (where % = all char before/after). Just edit pseudo.fix to specify the pseudo to use.


How to develop on this plugin:

I made this plugin using Netbeans 7.0 (this IDE has the particularity to integrate apache maven project by default), I only linked as a library the bukkit jar file.
The main class is Phpbbpm.class


Special thanks to :

- Mojang for developing this great game Minecraft is and for giving us the source code of the server.
- Bukkit.org for giving me the opportunity to develop a plugin for Minecraft on their awesome free open source mod.
- Amazou.fr players who tested the plugin.
