PhpbbPM README

How it works:
On player game join, if the player got a new pm, a reminder is displayed.
Every X minutes (7 by default), if the player got a new pm, a reminder is displayed either.

Usage:

/pmhelp
display in-game help for phpbbpm

/pmlist
list all new pm

/pmread [id]
read new pm.
id (gave by pmlist) is optional, without it the last new pm you received will be displayed.

/pmsend <player> <subject> <message>
send a pm.
the subject must be in one word. if you use an underscore ('_'), it will be replaced by a space (' ').


Installation:

Make sure you have a phpbb 3 forum installed.
Make sure your players have a similar name on your forum and on Minecraft.
Put phpbbpm.jar and the phpbbpm folder into your bukkit plugins folder.
edit config.properties and specify the database properties of your phpbb forum.

The 'unread_warning_delay' property correspond to the schedule new pm reminder.

Note: if the phpbbpm folder or the config file does not exists, a default one will be generate.


Known bug:
If you have players with similar pseudo, the plugin can match the wrong user because the search is made by a lower(username) = lower('%pseudo%') (where % = all char before/after).


How to develop on this plugin:
I made this plugin using Netbeans 7.0 (this IDE has the particularity to integrate apache maven project by default), I only linked as a library the bukkit jar file.
The main class is Phpbbpm.class


Special thanks to :
- Mojang for developing this great game Minecraft is and for giving us the source code of the server.
